# Web Portal Instructions
----------------------------------------------
#### In order to properly run the web portal on your local machine, perform the following simple steps

  - Ensure PHP is installed and updated
  - Ensure proper ports (8080 in this example) are open and firewall is not blocking emails (happens on Syracuse campus wifi)
  - Open the 'Web Portal' directory in terminal
  - Enter the command `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`
  - Visit localhost:8080 or the ip and port entered (127.0.0.1:8080) in any web browser to use the web portal

#### To use the hosted web server

  - Create your account on the desktop app & add items
  - Visit http://ec2-3-17-159-149.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ and input email & password
